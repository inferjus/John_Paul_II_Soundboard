Java application with an image of pope John Paul II and over fifty quotes of his to play.

Created by: Adam Joseph Bogush AKA "Inferjus" with Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - 2022-06. Tested on Windows 10 operating system.

You can paint cake images over the pope's portrait or remove them with first two buttons in button panel (left part of the app).
The other buttons are used to play sounds (quotes of John Paul II from this video: https://youtu.be/3lOgy4cWCEY). All of them are labeled and full quote can be read in text panel (right part of the app).

This program is not supposed to offend the pope or anybody else. It was made with lighthearted and drolly intent and should be treated as such.
Another reason for creation of this program is to practice writing code in Java and using Java Swing library.
